# the begining

to begin this raid, all gaurdians need to walk forward into the palace in front of the spawn. once here, there is some dialogue from riven, and an obvious trap door on the left wall opens. there is a pretty straightforward path to the first encounter, it's a pretty hard to miss door that unlocks when approached.

## the wall of wishes

to get to the wall of wishes, continue to the room before the first encounter. make a left and jump across a bit of water onto a rock, from there follow a series of grassy platforms with glowing plants; these will take you to the wall. to input a wish, shoot the panels until they are on the correct symbol. once you're done, stand on the plate.
